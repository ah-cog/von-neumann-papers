# The von Neumann Papers

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to increase the longevity and readership 
of the works of John von Neumann, a 20th-century figure responsible for 
many advances in game theory, theoretical physics, and computer science.

Some of the foundational works in computer science are currently propagated 
as unsearchable PDFs collated from photocopies, or Web pages whose formatting
is so poor that they are unreadable. Our aim here is to meticulously typeset
these works, emending as necessary, to make them more visually attractive, 
readable, and future-proof.

## Papers

### *Preliminary discussion of the logical design of an electronic computing instrument* (Part I)
**Authors**: Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann

This is one of the earliest papers on the design of a programmable digital 
computer. Part I discusses the design of the computing hardware and gives an 
overview of the instruction set. Part II focuses on transforming problems into 
instructions for the computer (coding).

**Status**: Complete. Seeking proofreaders and better formatting for figures and tables.
